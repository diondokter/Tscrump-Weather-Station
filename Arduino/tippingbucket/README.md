Arduino should send the number of bucket tips to the server, which multiplies it with the amount of millimeters of rain per bucket tip to get a total amount of mm of rain. This allows for changing or adjustment of values on the serverside, without having to reprogram the weather station's microcontroller. This can be useful if the precision of the rain meter is found to be off and needs to be adjusted, or if the rain meter has been recalibrated. The resolution of the meter is 0.27 mm per bucket tip as of writing, but this is dependent on the calibration.

There is no method for resetting the number of bucket tips yet. This code will keep counting until an integer overflow occurs. It is recommended to set the tipCounter variable to 0 when sending the information over LoRa to the server. This will mean that the information sent to the server is the number of bucket tips that occured since the last update. This is dependent on the code for the communication with the server.
