We'll need the following functions of this library:

- startTemperature()
- getTemperature()
These will return a value in C (degrees)

- startPressure()
- getPressure()
These will return a value in mb (millibar) / hPa (hectoPascal)

The only connections the chip needs is
- (GND) to GND
+ (VDD) to 3.3V (not 5!)
